title: Completed Practical JavaScript by Gorson Zhu
---

Gordon Zhu has created an amazing free resource [Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com) for learning vanilla JavaScript.

I have been learning to code on and off for the past year and have not come across a resource as good as this. I have been overwhelmed with the amount of resources and content available today and have wasted alot of my time trialling different resources instead of focusing my effort on learning JavaScript.

Many other JavaScript resources simply explain the different components of JavaScript and how you can create and maniuplate them, but they fail to put all concepts together into a functioning project.

Gordon's approach involves a simple ToDo list project, but he explains and introduces new features as they are needed. He sets out the code in an efficient and practical way focusing on MVC architecture.

I struggled to put all the pieces together from other JavaScript resources, but Gordon ties it all together in this brilliant resource.

I will be taking his Advanced Courses in the near Future.

### Currently working on
[30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challange](https://javascript30.com/) by Wes Bos. I want to learn more about Browser API's and maniulating the DOM
